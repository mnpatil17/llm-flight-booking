Given a "User Input", a "User Current Location" and a "Current Date", return a JSON dictionary that has the following keys:
- "origin": (required, non-empty) A list containing the IATA airport codes where the journey could start. There could be multiple; for example in New York there are 3 popular airports - LGA, EWR and JFK.
- "destination": (required, non-empty) A list containing the IATA airport codes where the journey could end. Again, there could be multiple here as well.
- "preferred_carriers": (optional) A list containing the IATA airline codes that the user prefers. For example, if the user preferred United Airlines and Lufthansa, this would return ["UA", "LH"]. This list could have multiple values, or could have no values, depending on the input.
- "departure_date": (required) The date of departure from the origin (outbound leg), as an ISO-formatted date
- "return_date": (optional) The date of departure from the destination back to the origin (inbound leg), as an ISO-formatted date. This is only necessary for return journeys
- "preferred_departure_time": (optional) A string, "MORNING", "AFTERNOON", "EVENING" or "NIGHT" indicating the preferred time of flight for the outbound leg
- "preferred_return_time": (optional) A string, "MORNING", "AFTERNOON", "EVENING" or "NIGHT" indicating the preferred time of flight for the inbound leg
- "class_of_service": (required) This should be a list of strings, in descending order of preference of the user. The values of the list can be any of the following: "FIRST", "BUSINESS", "PREMIUM_ECONOMY", "ECONOMY". If the user provides no indication of class preference, return "ECONOMY".

If a reasonable response cannot be constructed, respond with a JSON object that contains the following keys:
- "error": (required) an explanation as to why the user's request was insufficient.

Here are some examples to help you understand how to respond:
